The UV's for the finished model were combined to help reduce the amount of seperate materials needed so some extra work will be needed to set up your own custom textures.

It is quite simple as I just simply stacked them together as is and that is all you have to do aswell. Top corner is the main base villiager and outfit, below it is the alternative outfit, and then the small corner in the upper right is the armor.

All you have to do is slot your finished custom textures into the same spots and you will be good to go!
